# walk_break_reminder
## Overview
This project periodically reminds you to get up and go for a walk by sounding a buzzer. The walk timer will only start when you exit your WiFi range. On top of that it makes sure that your walk was long enough by shining an LED only when you have walked long enough. After you come back it reconnects with WiFi and sends your stats to Strava. For easy configuration it hosts a website for adding WiFi networks and logging into Strava.
